## openGit.ps1 ü™ü

This PowerShell script allows you to easily open Git Bash in a specified directory on a Windows machine. The script uses the ``Set-Location`` command to change to the desired directory and then runs the ``Start-Process`` command to launch Git Bash with the ``git-bash.exe`` executable.

The script is currently configured to work on a Windows machine, but it can be modified to work on other operating systems as well. Simply change the value of the ``$directory`` and ``$git`` variables to point to the desired directory and Git Bash executable, respectively.

To use the script, save it as a file with a .ps1 extension and run it from the PowerShell command line with ``.\<script_name>.ps1``.
